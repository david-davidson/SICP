# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
## Notes and Exercises

This repo collects notes and exercises from _SICP_. The notes live in Markdown files like `chapters/1/README.md`, and the exercises live in individual files like `chapters/1/1.1.scm`.

These notes aren't intended to be complete. Instead, they capture information that's new to me (or otherwise illuminating).

Likewise, I'm skipping certain exercises: in particular, those that assume enough math knowledge that (for me) they're more about math than programming. In general, I'm skipping exercises that involve enough friction that they risk stopping forward momentum.

### Contents
* [Chapter 1](chapters/1)
* [Chapter 2](chapters/2)

### Getting started
To install Scheme (on Mac), run:
