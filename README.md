# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
## Notes and Exercises

This repo collects notes and exercises from _SICP_. The notes live in Markdown files like `chapters/1/README.md`, and the exercises live in individual files like `chapters/1/1.1.scm`.

These notes aren't intended to be complete. Instead, they capture information that's new to me. (More, they capture information that is both new to me and specific to programmingâ€”much of the math is also new to me, but outside the scope of these notes.)

Likewise, certain of the exercises assume enough math knowledge that (for me) they become more about math than programming; I've opted to skip these for now.
