# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
## Notes and Exercises

This repo collects notes and exercises from _SICP_. The notes live in Markdown files like `chapters/1/README.md`, and the exercises live in individual files like `chapters/1/1.1.scm`.

These notes aren't intended to be complete. Instead, they capture information that's new to me (or otherwise illuminating).

Likewise, certain of the exercises assume enough math knowledge that (for me) they're more about math than programming; I've opted to skip these for now.
