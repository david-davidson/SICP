# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
## Notes and Exercises

This repo collects notes and exercises from _SICP_. The notes live in Markdown files like `chapters/1/README.md`, and the exercises live in individual files like `chapters/1/1.1.scm`.

These notes aren't intended to be complete. Instead, they're personalâ€”they capture information that's new or otherwise illuminating.

Likewise, I'm skipping certain exercises: in particular, those that involve enough friction that they risk stopping forward momentum.

### Contents
* [Chapter 1](chapters/1)
* [Chapter 2](chapters/2)
* [Chapter 3](chapters/3)
* [Chapter 4](chapters/4)

### Getting started
To install Scheme (on Mac), run:
```
$ brew install mit-scheme
```

To load a particular exercise in the Scheme REPL, run:
```
$ scheme -load <path/to/exercise>.scm
```

### Going deeper
I'm writing about a handful of favorite SICP themes at https://daviddavidson.website/tags/sicp/
